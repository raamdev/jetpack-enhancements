jetpack-mods
====================

A WordPress plugin that provides several enhancements to the JetPack plugin

## Publicize Module Changes

- **Twitter**: When a post is published with a post format of *Aside* or *Quote* and the entire body of the post + the URL will fit inside a Tweet, then Jetpack Publicize will post the entire body of the post to Twitter + the URL (instead of posting only the Title + URL). For Quote format posts, when using `<cite>` tags to separate the author of the quote from the quote itself, double-quotes will be added to the quote before posting to Twitter, if they don't already exist. ([Less is more. - Someone] becomes ["Less is more." - Someone]).
